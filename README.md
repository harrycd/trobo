Modelling of Forex data for future price prediction.

Forex data is considered by many a random walk.
The project uses common technical analysis indicators in a unique combination in an attempt to build a profitable model. 
The data is obtained by www.histdata.com

PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THAT A PROFITABLE MODEL IN THEORY IS FAR FROM A PROFITABLE MODEL IN PRACTICE.
EXTERNAL FACTORS SUCH AS TRANSACTION FEES AND DELAYS HAVE A MASSIVE IMPACT IN THE LONG TERM.
